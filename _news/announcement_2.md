Participated in SBUHacks IV at Stony Brooks University. 

---

I recently had a pretty intense one. I slept for only 3 hours out of 48! ðŸ˜Š

But that was all worth it because I had an amazing time attending my first Major League Hacking event at Stony Brook University, organized by SBUHacks. I got to work with some amazing teammates, including Vishwanath Badiger, Anirudh Desai, and Vanshika Sandeep. We had a great time collaborating and learning from each other, working outside of our comfort zones.

One of the highlights of the event was meeting Sonny Li, the founder of CodÃ©dex. I was impressed by their work and highly recommend you check out their cool website at [https://www.codedex.io/](https://www.codedex.io/).

I want to express my gratitude to SBUHacks and its volunteers for organizing such a wonderful event. It was a great opportunity to learn, network, and have fun. Looking forward to attending more events like this in the future!
